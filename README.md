# Shiny

This is a fork of golang.org/exp/shiny. 
The goal of this fork is to add additional window management functionality, and
focus the project down to just window management.

## Long Term Plans 

1. Standardize interfaces across OSes
2. Add new drivers for better performance, optional CGO
3. Add Fullscreen and screen movement to all OSes 
4. Add Window scaling types (bicubic, etc.) to all OSes
